<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Fountainize?

[![Fountainize Screen Shot][fountainize-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Fountainize lets you write simple text and convert it into a beautifully formatted script all with the press of a button. Collaborative screenwriting has never been this easy!

Fountainize is based on the Fountain markup language. By writing your text following a simple set of rules, Fountainize is able to determine what should be a character, dialogue, action, or any other part of a script. Don't worry though! The rules are easy.

Fountainize was built specifically so you can reap all the benefits of Google Docs while still making professional looking screenplays. Now, Fountainize won't replace professional screenwriting software (it doesn't do continued dialogue or exceptions to rules) but it is the BEST tool for efficiently writing drafts or personal projects. And of course, working with friends!
